                    Digital agencies’ main asset is their team of digital experts. You want to assess their expertise as well as work culture to determine whether you can develop a true partnership with the agency.
                    
                    We recommend going even a step further and asking to meet the people who would be assigned to your account.
                    
                    Question #2: Will you provide consultation and ideas?
                    
                    You’d be surprised at how many agencies deliver their service passively, awaiting your requests and instructions.
                    
                    You want your digital agency to take leadership on your project by consulting you as well as executing the approved strategies and reporting on your progress regularly.
                    
                    Other important questions to ask are:
                    
                    Do you have experience with similar projects?
